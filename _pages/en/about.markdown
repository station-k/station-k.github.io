**Ko-Station** is an intellectual community of Ukrainians, established in 2022 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The name "Ko" honors **Yevhen Konovalets**, a prominent Ukrainian figure of the early 20th century. Konovalets was assassinated by a Soviet-Russian spy near Hotel Atlanta in Rotterdam. He is interred at Crooswijk Cemetery. His assassination was a direct result of his steadfast commitment to the cause of Ukrainian independence.
