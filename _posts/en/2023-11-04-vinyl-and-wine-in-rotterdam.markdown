On the 4th of November, the community and friends of Konovalets Station gathered in Rotterdam.

We conversed, danced, indulged in organic wines, listened to vinyl records with Ukrainian retro music, and learned more about it.

In addition, at the charity auction, we raffled off records for donations to the ["Sails of Freedom"](https://zeilenvanvrijheid.nl/) fund.

Also, all guests had the opportunity to participate in a charity lottery and win a record!

Thanks to the auction, lottery, ticket sales, and your donations, **we managed to raise â‚¬2295**.

All these funds have been transferred to the ["Sails of Freedom"](https://zeilenvanvrijheid.nl/) fund, which is involved in purchasing ambulance cars and sending them to Ukraine.

All this became possible at our cozy location - [LenselinQ Wine Import](https://lenselinq.nl/). They treated us with their wine and prepared delicious snacks!

We are grateful to the ["Sails of Freedom"](https://zeilenvanvrijheid.nl/) fund for cooperation and the opportunity to contribute to their important cause.

Let's achieve more together!
